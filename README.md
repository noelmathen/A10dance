## ðŸ“– How It Works

1. **Attendance Updates**:

   - Uses **signals** (`pre_save`, `post_save`, `pre_delete`, `post_delete`) to automatically:
     - Recalculate attendance percentages.
     - Sync hours and details across `BranchHourDetails` and `Course` models.
   - Tracks changes in attendance and generates real-time updates.
2. **Email Notification System**:

   - Integrated with Django's email framework.
   - Notifies students immediately when their attendance records change.
3. **Attendance Prediction**:

   - Uses the following formula to estimate future percentages:
     ```
     Predicted Percentage = ((Current Total Hours - Total Missed Hours - Estimated Future Missed Hours) / Current Total Hours) * 100
     ```
   - Displays predictions in the frontend for proactive planning.
4. **Frontend Integration**:

   - APIs provide:
     - Branch and course-level attendance details.
     - Attendance percentages and predictions.
   - Frontend dynamically updates to reflect changes in real-time.
